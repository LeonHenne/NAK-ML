    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Use scikit-learn with popular datasets to perform machine learning studies.\n",
    "* Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize and explore data. \n",
    "* Perform supervised machine learning with k-nearest neighbors classification and linear regression.\n",
    "* Perform multi-classification with Digits dataset.\n",
    "* Divide a dataset into training, test and validation sets.\n",
    "* Tune model hyperparameters with k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "* Measure model performance.\n",
    "* Display a confusion matrix showing classification prediction hits and misses.\n",
    "* Perform multiple linear regression with the California Housing dataset.\n",
    "* Perform dimensionality reduction with PCA and t-SNE on the Iris and Digits datasets to prepare them for two-dimensional visualizations.\n",
    "* Perform unsupervised machine learning with k-means clustering and the Iris dataset."
